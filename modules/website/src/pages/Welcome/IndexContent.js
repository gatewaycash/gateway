          <p>
            Gateway is making Bitcoin Cash (BCH) easy for merchants and website
            operators across the world. By standardizing the Bitcoin Cash
            payment experience, we can reduce friction and build on top of
            Bitcoin together.

        <p>
          Gateway is an open platform pioneering open standards for the future
          of payments. We want to build a standard, unified and positive
          experience for both customers and merchants who decide that Bitcoin

        <h2>Doing it for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
          Billions of people across the earth don't have the financial tools
          they need to earn, save and build a life for themselves and their
          families. By making connections with shopkeepers and forging
          relationships with everyday people in third-world countries, we are
          learning their needs and building those tools on top of Bitcoin Cash.
