        Gateway is making Bitcoin Cash (BCH) easy for merchants and website
        operators across the world. By standardizing the Bitcoin Cash payment
        experience, we can reduce friction and build on top of Bitcoin together.

      <h2>Doing it Together</h2>
      <p>
        Gateway is an open platform pioneering open standards for the future of
        payments. We want to build a standard, unified and positive experience
        for both customers and merchants who decide that Bitcoin Cash is the

      <h2>Doing it for Everyone</h2>
      <p>
        Billions of people across the earth don't have the financial tools they
        need to earn, save and build a life for themselves and their families.
        By making connections with shopkeepers and forging relationships with
        everyday people in third-world countries, we are learning their needs
        and building those tools on top of Bitcoin Cash.
