            <h3>About Unpaid and Unprocessed Payments</h3>
            <Text>
              Unpaid and unprocessed payments usually occur when a customer
              clicks on a payment button but then closes it without making a
              payment. Pending payments (payments that haven't yet been
              processed) will also fall into this category.

            <h3>About Private Keys</h3>
            <Text>
              In short, a private key is like a password that unlocks the funds
              in a cryptocurrency address. Private keys should never be shared
              because anyone with your private keys can spend the money stored
              in the respective address. Likewise, no one can steal money from
              an address without the private key.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              Your Bitcoin wallet generally keeps track of your private keys for
              you. For addresses created by Gateway, we'll manage those keys but
              will optionally share them with you. It's your money after all!
