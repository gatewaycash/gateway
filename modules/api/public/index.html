    <h1>Gateway.cash API Docs</h1>
  </center>
  <p>
    You've reached the backend server API documentation landing page. This
    server may be used to interface with the <a href="https://gateway.cash"
    target="_blank">gateway.cash</a> payment processor.
  </p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The API is served over HTTP or HTTPS with your current URL as a basepoint.
    If you are running a local instance of the server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    then your requests will start with that URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the endpoint for /login would be http://127.0.0.1:8080/login
    on your local instance. The examples in this documentation assume you are
    using a basepoint URL of https://api.gateway.cash/ which is the production
    server Gateway uses across all of our services.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are free to use our API server as you wish. If we receive excessive
    spam we may choose to block your access. Like all open-source projects, you
    are also free to run your own server on the internet if you wish.
  </p>
  <h2>The Gateway API</h2>
  <p>
    The Gateway API can be used by merchants and customers to access invoices,
    manage orders and make payments. Merchant API keys are required in order to
    access invoices and account information.
  </p>
  <p>
    No API keys are required when making or confirming a payment.
  </p>
  <h2>API Requests</h2>
  <p>
    Making a request to the API will result in a JSON object string being
    returned. The "status" property of the object will either be "success" or
    "error" for all requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of an error, the "error" property will contain a brief error
    message and "description" will contain a more in-depth description of the
    problem, suitable for showing to your users.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of a "success" status field, the object will contain the
    relevant information as described below for each endpoint.
  </p>
  <h2>API Endpoints</h2>
  <h3>GET /login</h3>
  <p>
    Validates a given session, returning the API key. The API key is required to
    access merchant- and account-related endpoints.
  </p>
  <p>
    The address must be a Bitcoin Cash address. If it is not in the CashAddress
    format it will be translated.
  </p>
  <h4>Parameters</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>"username" or "address" is required</li>
    <li>"password" is required</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Examples</h4>
  <pre class="code">
GET https://api.gateway.cash/login
?address=bitcoincash:pz3txlyql9vc08px98v69a7700g6aecj5gc0q3xhng
&password=Super$ecret1
  </pre>
  <pre class="code">
GET https://api.gateway.cash/login
?username=JohnGalt12
&password=IHeartDagney
  </pre>
  <h4>Return Value</h4>
  <pre class="code">
{
  "status": "success",
  "APIKey": "aaaa00001111ed3f8429e9b5c73122bed3f8429e9b5c73122bed3f842deaddea"
}
  </pre>
  <pre class="code">
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Invalid Login",
  "description": "An incorrect address, username or password was provided."
}
  </pre>
  <h3>POST /register</h3>
  <p>
    Creates a new merchant account and generates an API key, merchant ID and
    other account information for the user. Once registration is complete,
    the newly-generated API key is returned to the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    The address must be a valid Bitcoin Cash address. If not given in
    CashAddress format, it will be translated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The username must be between 5 and 24 characters, must be unique, must not
    contain spaces or other odd characters, and is an optional parameter at
    registration time. Usernames can always be set later with the /setusername
    endpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    The password must be secure, unique and must not contain odd characters such
    as returns, tabs or spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>BE AWARE:</b> The API does not validate that passwords are secure or have
    entropy. It is the responsibility of the user and/or the front-end
    software provider to ensure that  a secure password is provided. Passwords
    are always salted and hashed prior to storing in a database.
  </p>
  <h4>Parameters</h4>

  <h3>POST /pay</h3>
  <p>
    Generates an invoice, returning the payment address to the user when the
    user gives the merchant ID. No API key is required for this API call.
  </p>
  <p>
    Payment IDs can also be sent which will be given to the merchant in order
    that they can track their orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Callback URLs can be sent which will be invoked by the server when the
    payment is received. Callbacks are sent as POST requests and will always
    contain a "secret" value which is the SHA256 hash of the merchant's API key.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>BE AWARE:</b> Merchants who leverage callback URLs MUST ALWAYS VERIFY
    that the request is authentic by making sure the "secret" provided is the
    SHA256 hash of the merchant's API key. API keys can be viewed and changed in
    the Settings screen.
